# Japanese-learning-app (YTN)

## Summary

This is a Japanese learning application designed for learners of the language. I created it because I felt that there isn’t much information available online for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), and there are far fewer free learning resources compared to English. I wanted to build a website where Japanese learners could better challenge themselves and track their progress.

Users can log in and solve questions. Their scores are recorded, allowing them to identify which areas they struggle with. The questions are categorized by level, so users can practice according to their own proficiency.

If they don’t understand an answer or why it is correct, they can ask ChatGPT AI directly on the site for an explanation.
