# Japanese-learning-app

## Summary

This is a Japanese learning app. 

Users can login and save their scores.

I use ChatGPT API and users can ask questions to AI.

## The reason why I made this app

I am teaching Japanese and I wanted to build something my students practice what they have learned.

Since they can store their scores, they can keep their progresses.

They can also ask ChatGPT if they have questions.
